## 🧾 Overvieww

The **Cloudinary Utility** provides a centralized and reusable method for handling file uploads in your application. Instead of rewriting file validation logic every time, this utility is designed to be called wherever an upload is needed. It ensures that all uploads are validated consistently based on file size and format type using semantic constants.

## 🧠 Why Use This Utility?

- ✅ No need to rewrite upload logic repeatedly
- 🔒 Built-in validation for file size and format
- 💡 Semantic format types improve readability and maintainability
- 🎨 Easily customizable upload widget (sources, styling, etc.)

## 🗂️ Supported Format Types

The utility supports the following predefined format groups:

| Format Type  | Supported Formats                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Image**    | jpeg, jpg, png, gif                       |
| **Document** | pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, csv |
| **Video**    | mp4, mov                                  |
| **Audio**    | mp3                                       |

You can use them via semantic constants:

```javascript
export const FORMAT_TYPES = {
  IMAGE: 'image',
  DOCUMENT: 'document',
  VIDEO: 'video',
  AUDIO: 'audio',
  ALL: 'all',
}
```

<Tip>
  You can pass either a single format type (e.g. FORMAT_TYPES.IMAGE) or an array of format types (e.g. [FORMAT_TYPES.IMAGE, FORMAT_TYPES.DOCUMENT]) when calling the utility.
</Tip>

- This limit is fixed and cannot be changed.
